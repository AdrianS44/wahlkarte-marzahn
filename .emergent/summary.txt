The AI engineer successfully transformed a frontend-only MVP into a robust full-stack application. Key achievements include implementing a comprehensive unified login system with JWT authentication, MongoDB for user and survey data, and an admin panel for user and survey management. Significant effort was also put into enhancing the interactive map (integrating correct GeoJSON boundaries with coordinate conversion, adding custom address geocoding with blue markers), improving dashboard visualizations (consistent gradient colors, extended correlation analysis), and refining user experience (clearer filter labels, robust error handling). The development hit a critical roadblock: a persistent  error due to an external Kubernetes Ingress routing issue, making the backend inaccessible from outside. As a result, the AI engineer is currently setting up a temporary no-login mode for the frontend, utilizing only static data, to allow continued dashboard usage.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to provide a dashboard for visualizing survey results from the Marzahn-Hellersdorf AGH electoral district. Key requirements include:
1.  **Data Visualization & Interactivity:** Display survey data (demographics, information sources, media usage, opinions like satisfaction, topics, future outlook). The dashboard must correlate demographic data with opinions, offer extensive interactive filters (age, location, satisfaction, social media, household size, etc.) that dynamically update charts. Charts must use consistent color schemes (e.g., a specific gradient for satisfaction levels 1-5) and show raw scale values for opinions.
2.  **Map Functionality:** An interactive map of Marzahn-Hellersdorf showing U-Bahn areas/Siedlungsgebiet with interactive points (U-Bahn stations) displaying data. Integration of electoral district boundaries using provided GeoJSON (initially SHP files) with a toggle feature. A crucial addition is the ability to manually input arbitrary addresses for citizen feedback, which should then appear on the map with appropriate markers.
3.  **Authentication & Data Management:** Evolve from a frontend-only MVP to a full-stack application with a secure login system. This system requires distinct access for admin and regular users. Admin users must have the capability to create and manage (add, edit, delete) other users, including a default test user. The admin panel also needs full CRUD operations for survey responses and CSV import/export. Admin credentials should allow access to both the admin panel and the main dashboard, and the login screen should be clean, without displaying default credentials.
4.  **Deployment & Control:** Discussions centered on options for permanent website availability (paid hosting via Emergent's Deploy, or free alternatives like GitHub + Vercel/Netlify) and the ability to easily deactivate or delete the deployed application.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture, featuring a React frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend, designed for modularity and scalability.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Renamed from the original main application component to become a simple wrapper that renders .
    *   **Changes:** Initially the main dashboard; later simplified to export a component, , to handle overall application routing and authentication. Most recently modified to bypass login logic.

*   **/app/frontend/src/AppWrapper.js**:
    *   **Importance:** A newly introduced central component responsible for managing application-wide routing (between main dashboard and admin sections) and user authentication states.
    *   **Changes:** Created to encapsulate the unified login system and routing. Most recently modified to temporarily bypass the login requirement due to infrastructure issues, directly rendering the Dashboard.

*   **/app/frontend/src/Dashboard.js**:
    *   **Importance:** The core of the application, displaying survey data through an interactive map and various charts, with extensive filtering capabilities. It was the original .
    *   **Changes:** Renamed from . It underwent numerous updates: improved data parsing and filtering (e.g., all 141 records), map coordinate accuracy, dynamic chart updates, consistent color assignments (now a gradient for satisfaction), extended filter functionality (full questions as labels). Integrated React-Leaflet for mapping and Chart.js for visualizations. Added display of electoral district boundaries using  with a toggle. Enhanced correlation analysis with more deductions and moved it to the top. Modified map markers to be green points (no circles) for U-Bahn areas. Implemented geocoding for  entries, displayed as blue markers. Debugged and fixed  dependency issues causing render errors and  initialization problems. Logic was updated to combine both static CSV data and live API data for a comprehensive dataset, then adjusted again to load *only* static CSV data when the login is bypassed.

*   **/app/frontend/src/UserLogin.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Provides the user interface for the unified login system, handling credential submission.
    *   **Changes:** Newly created as part of the backend integration. It manages login state, communicates with the backend, and stores JWT tokens. Modified to remove test login credentials from display for security. Enhanced with better error handling and debug logging for connection issues.

*   **/app/frontend/src/AdminDashboard.js**:
    *   **Importance:** The administrative interface allowing CRUD operations on survey data and now also managing user accounts.
    *   **Changes:** Newly created for survey data management. Significantly expanded to include a user management section with a tabbed interface. Implemented functionality to add, edit, and delete users. The survey entry form was updated to include a  field with validation, allowing users to input arbitrary locations.

*   **/app/frontend/src/wahlkreis-grenzen.json**:
    *   **Importance:** Stores the geographical data in GeoJSON format for the Marzahn-Hellersdorf electoral district boundaries displayed on the map.
    *   **Changes:** Initially created with a rough estimate of boundaries, then completely replaced with user-provided, accurate GeoJSON data.

*   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    *   **Importance:** The core FastAPI backend application, serving as the API for data handling, authentication, and user management.
    *   **Changes:** Replaced original content with a full FastAPI setup. Implemented JWT-based authentication with  and . Added  middleware for role-based access control. Integrated MongoDB for persistent storage of both survey responses and user accounts. Developed API endpoints for full user CRUD operations. Configured auto-initialization of default users (/, /) on application startup. The  model was extended to include a  field for flexible location input. JWT token validity was increased from 30 minutes to 120 minutes. A diagnostic  endpoint was added. Multiple attempts were made to resolve external access issues by modifying the server's listening port (8001, 8000, 8080) and restarting supervisor.

*   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    *   **Importance:** Stores environment variables for the frontend, primarily .
    *   **Changes:**  was configured to point to the backend service. During infrastructure debugging, attempts were made to hardcode a direct port into this URL to bypass Kubernetes Ingress issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   The critical issue of the **Kubernetes Ingress routing failure** (resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors for external backend access) remains unresolved and requires external support.
-   The frontend has been temporarily reconfigured to **bypass the login system** and load only static CSV data, meaning the user management and new custom address features requiring backend interaction are currently inaccessible in this mode.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently engaged in a critical debugging effort to resolve a persistent  error that prevented the frontend from connecting to the backend API. This issue specifically manifested during login attempts and any API calls to , effectively rendering the full-stack features (login, user management, custom address saving/display) unusable from an external browser.

Despite thorough internal checks confirming the backend () was running correctly on port 8001 (and attempts to change it to 8000 and 8080 via  proved futile for external access), and frontend configurations (, ) were correct, the problem persisted. The AI engineer concluded that this is an **infrastructure-level Kubernetes Ingress routing issue** which is beyond the scope of a software engineer to fix with code changes, requiring intervention from platform support.

As a direct response to the user's request for a temporary workaround, the AI engineer is now configuring the frontend to function without requiring a login. This involves:
1.  Modifying  to remove the login conditional rendering, allowing direct access to the dashboard.
2.  Adjusting  to rely solely on the embedded static CSV data for survey responses, as the external backend API remains unreachable.
The last action taken was updating  to switch to CSV-only data loading when bypassing login.

<optional_next_step>
Add a development mode notification to the frontend to inform the user that the application is running without backend connectivity.
